                        <h3>To Master Ernesto "Aigi" Abasolo III</h3>
                        <p>I started my career in Web Development with Proweaver as your mere student in one of your sessions in the different schools in Cebu. And at the end of the session, I was amazed at how beautiful Web Development can be. You have always given life and joy to all the training that you've held and I was lucky enough to be one of those students that have been under your supervision. Because of you, I was attracted to Web Development and became more curious about what awaits us when we start our journey with this company. I was glad that I started my career in Proweaver because I was able to learn very much about the development of websites and I was also able to meet amazing people along the way. Thank you for being patient and helpful to us when we are trapped in a problem. On behalf of all the developers that you've helped in our journey here with Proweaver, we would like to say thank you for everything that you've imparted to us. We have been blessed and very lucky to have you as our mentor and trainer. Thank you is not enough to describe what you've done for the team and team members and we will forever be grateful and in your debt for all the help that you've given us.</p>
