                        <h3>To Jeval Jane Tamidles</h3>
                        <p>Friendship is not measured on how long you've been friends with a person, but on how deep you've bonded with the person. That being said, I believe that I can call you my friend. Even if your journey with this company is coming to a close. I'm just thankful to have a very passionate and reliable friend on you. Even if we won't be talking regularly as we have used to, I believe that we will continue being friends regardless if we ever stopped working together. All in all, good luck on your future endeavors and I am rooting for your success in the new path that you've chosen for yourself. Thank you for everything and it has been an honor working with you.</p>
